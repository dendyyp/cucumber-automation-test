## Test Application Analysis
I do analysis in Youtap pos, due to link on assessment files not supported in iOS.


### Areas of Improvement

1. No error message or information to user

   When user want to create new category on Youtap, then category not created. User tap Simpan button, but no functionality. I think, it's better if there is a message if the user fails to create a new category. So, the user will know if they made a mistake.
   
2. Inappropriate behavior

User tap other than close (X) icon, sidebar remains closed. My suggestion if there's close button, sidebar can closed only when user tap the close icon.

3. Confusing auto selected number '0', '00', '000'

User input manual product prices and when user tap multiplication, then '0', '00', '000' auto selected, even though the user only uses one '0', but all '0', '00', and '000' are auto-selected. This can be improved so that users are not confused

4. Difficult to add new product for new users

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45061250/197227021-8eae5b4d-d4a0-4404-8977-d29b53eee4fd.MP4

After user add new product, user redirect to Daftar Produk page but there is no feature of adding products anymore in Daftar Produk. User should visit Edit Product on sidebar if want to add more product. I think it's kinda confusing for new users. My suggestion, nice to have if on Daftar Produk page there is a button to add a product, maybe can using logo like '+' so it will make user more easier to upload more product without visit edit product from hamburger bar.

### Notes[^Notes]

[^Notes]: I wrote the analysis and suggestion above due to the difficulty or confusion that I feel when using the Youtap Pos application
